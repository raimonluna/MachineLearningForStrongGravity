# Machine Learning For Strong Gravity

## Short course for the Group meeting: "State of the art techniques in Strong gravity"
## SƒÅo Pedro do Sul (Portugal), 26-28 April 2023
## Meeting website: http://gravitation.web.ua.pt/index.php/node/4326

## Lectures:

1. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
How to use PINNs to solve differential equations, including ODEs, PDEs and eigenvalue problems.
How these can be used, for instance, for the computation of QNMs and the solution of Einstein's equations.

2. Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
How to reduce the dimensionality of data by finding an appropriate basis of vectors.
How autoencoders "compress" the data by automatically identifying the governing parameters.
How we can use GANs to generate samples from the same distribution as the training data.

3. Learning Orbital Dynamics from Gravitational Waveforms
How we can learn the corrections to the Newtonian equations of motion by analyzing gravitational waves.
