## Lectures:

### 1. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)

</a>

- How to use PINNs to solve differential equations, including ODEs, PDEs and eigenvalue problems.
- How these can be used, for instance, for the computation of QNMs and the solution of Einstein's equations.

### 2. Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

</a>

- How to reduce the dimensionality of data by finding an appropriate basis of vectors.
- How autoencoders "compress" the data by automatically identifying the governing parameters.
- How we can use GANs to generate samples from the same distribution as the training data.

### 3. Learning Orbital Dynamics from Gravitational Waveforms
